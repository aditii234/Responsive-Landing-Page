<p><b>Advantages of application</b><br>
  The most important part of any trip is planning because if you plan well, you are sure to enjoy your trip better. And online ticket bookings allow you just that. You can check for trains routes to your destination, compare prices with other nearby routes, choose from AC/non-AC sections as per your preference and more, all within a few minutes and with just a few taps on your phone. You can also avail of immediate cancellation in case of a sudden change in plans, within a few seconds, and without the hassle of falling in line for counter bus ticket booking. Online bus reservation lets you have an m-Ticket which again has its advantages. You do not need to carry a physical ticket, so the chances of forgetting it back at home are not there anymore. All you have to do is show your mobile screen at the counter, displaying the m-Ticket and you are sorted. Oh! And make sure to carry your government identity proof with you at all times.</p>

<p><b>Curious</b><br>
Manual attendance keeping is cumbersome because it involves manually recording attendance in timesheets. As managers have to maintain these timesheets and manually input data into payroll software periodically, it’s not difficult to anticipate how time-consuming this entire process can be. Online attendance systems entirely automate the timekeeping of employees. Modern online attendance apps like Truein can be easily integrated with payroll software. It eliminates the requirement to manually share data between attendance and payroll software.</p>

<p><b>Creative</b><br>
A unique feature of some online attendance systems is that they allow real-time monitoring of employees. In industries like mining, construction, and manufacturing, where the workforce is scattered over a large area, real-time attendance tracking effectively discourages time theft and calculates working hours more accurately</p>
